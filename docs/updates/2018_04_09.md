## Shared workspaces

We spent the entire week [laying down the foundations that will enable shared workspaces](https://github.com/atom/xray/pull/61). What are shared workspaces? The basic idea is that you'll be able to start a headless Xray instance on a remote machine, then have multiple developers connect and co-inhabit that workspace from their local machines.

The fact that our buffers are CRDTs makes concurrent buffer editing relatively straightforward to implement, but we still need a solution for synchronizing state between peers and performing requests and response. After experimenting a bit with Cap'N Proto RPC and feeling a bit overwhelmed by the generated code, we decided to explore what a custom solution might look like.

We're not quite done with the implementation, but after a lot of thinking and a bit of wheel-spinning, we have a reasonably solid design for a capabilities-based RPC system that will be a good fit for our use case. I've written up [a much deeper description](https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/shared-workspaces/docs/architecture/002_shared_workspaces.md) that will become part of Xray's permanent documentation. Here's a *huge* diagram to get you interested:

## The week ahead

We hope to finish an initial take on the RPC system next week, then start using it to build out a basic demo of shared workspaces. Our goal is to make it possible to find and open paths on the client and support concurrent editing by multiple clients. That may spill into the following week, when I'll be traveling Amsterdam for some in-person full-throttle coding with [@as-cii](https://github.com/as-cii).
